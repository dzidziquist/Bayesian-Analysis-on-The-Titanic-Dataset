# Bayesian-Analysis-on-The-Titanic-Dataset

This is a final project in Statistical Methods for Data Science and Laboratory at Sapienza University of Rome. 
The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset. The main aim of this project is to perform a bayesian analysis on the probability of the females and males surviving based on the observed data on the survived variable. 
Also, to perform a bayesian logistic regression based on the sex or gender in order to predict future observations or missing observations.
